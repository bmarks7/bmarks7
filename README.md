## Hello, welcome to my profile!

### About Me

I'm Brandon Marks and I'm currently a computer science student at the University of Western Ontario. I'm in between the 3rd and 4th year of my program, currently doing an internship as a software developer with J.D. Power on the General Motors team. My anticipated graduation date is April 2024.

My programming journey started when I was 12 years old when I attended a STEM oriented summer camp at the University of Toronto where I learned coding using Python.

Over my years in programming, I've mostly worked on full-stack web applications and I've also done some work in mobile development and machine learning. When I graduate, I want to become a software engineer because I want to design and build software that will improve people's lives.

Here are some of the technologies I've worked with:<br/><br/>
**Programming Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C<br/>
**Front End Technologies**: HTML, CSS, React, React Native<br/>
**Back End Technologies**: Sprint Boot, Node.js, Django, Flask<br/>
**Databases**: SQL, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL<br/>
**Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas<br/>
**Other**: Unix, Git, AWS
